Is it so? Let 's look at the relationship between weight and mpg.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(x = carsData$wt, y = carsData$mpg)\n```\n\nCorrelation\n========================================================\n\nWe have a established that there might be a relationship between transmission-type and mpg. But there are more variables at play. How do they influence mpg? Let 's see how all variables correlate to mpg:\n\n```{r}\ncor(mtcars)[1,]\n```\n\nThe variable mostly correlated to mpg is wt (weight). This is what one would expect. The heavier a car, the more energy it needs for 1 mile.\n\n",
